## Lecture 2

- where does supply and demand curve come from?


### Demand curve
- how consumers make choices.
1. preferences
2. utility

utilitiy maximization
-preferences
budget constraint

Model:
preference assumptions
1. Completeness: you have preferences over ANY choices. Indifference is fine.
2. Transitivity: Prefer a to b, b to c then prefer a to c
3. Non-satiation (a.k.a. more is always better)

### Indifference curves (IC)

Properties
1. Consumers prefer higher indifference curves
2. IC are downward sloping. (Otherwise non-satiation is violated.)
3. IC never cross. (Otherwise transitivity is violated)
4. Only one IC through every bundle. (Completeness)

### Supply
how firms make
