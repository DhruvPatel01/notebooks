    "TODO: Typeset paper notes to this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $\\gamma = \\sqrt{1 - v^2} = \\sqrt{1 - (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2)}$. (In relativistic units, i.e., unitless). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian\n",
    "- in relativistic units $\\cal{L} = - m \\gamma$.\n",
    "- in normal units $\\cal{L} = -m c^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From classical mechanics, momentum and energy are conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relativistic Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum is defined as $P_i = \\frac{\\partial \\cal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{X^i}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- the x component is $P^x = \\frac{\\partial \\cal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}}$\n",
    "- carry out the algebra, and find, $P^x = \\frac{m \\dot{x}}{\\gamma}$\n",
    "- more generally, $P^i = \\frac{m V^i}{\\gamma} = m U^i$\n",
    "- compare it with classical $P_i = mV^i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relativistic Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "- general form of energy is $H = \\Sigma_i \\dot{Q^i} P_i - \\cal{L}$.\n",
    "- for moving particle it is $H = \\Sigma_i \\dot{X^i} P^i - \\cal{L}$.\n",
    "- with all the information, carry out the substitution and do algebra to find $H = \\frac{m}{\\gamma}$.\n",
    "- But, recall that $U^0 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}$. Thus, $P^0 = mU^0$.\n",
    "- The three components of spatical momentum $P^i$ together with energy $P^0$ form a 4-vector. \n",
    "- the components of energy oand momentum get mixed up under a Lerentz transformation. In stationary frame, a particle has energy but no momentum, while in another frame it has both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slow moving particle\n",
    "- in normal units $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.\n",
    "- with the help of binomial approximation $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}$. The approximation only holds for slow particles.\n",
    "- $E = mc^2 + \\frac{mv^2}{2}$.\n",
    "    - Even stationary objects contain some enrgy. This equation shows that it is $E = mc^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Massless particles\n",
    "- Massless particles have velocity = 1. So $E = \\frac{m}{\\gamma} = \\frac{0}{0}$. This is not determined. Thus, it is possible to have different energies even if the massless particles have same velocities."
