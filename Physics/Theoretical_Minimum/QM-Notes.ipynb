The result of doing it otherway (i.e. B or A) will be the same as doing (A or B). The reason is that classically, measurements are gentle. They don't change the state of the system.\n",

    "If some entity prepares the spin in $\\sigma_z = +1$ state, and we measure `A or B` (whether we use short circuit or not), we will measure it to be true. However, if we measure `B or A`, there is 25% chance that we will measure it to be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about `A and B`? If we conclude that `A and B` is true, can we confirm it again? Answer is no. Since to compute B, we had to measure $\\sigma_x$, which ruined measurement of A. Thus we can't confirm it. i.e. experiment is not reproducible."
