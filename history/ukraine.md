# The Genesis of Nations

How do we get from nothing to something?
- nations
- classes

Nations once exists, it claims to the past.

    Primary education generally answers this question.
    This creates a cycle. 
    Institutional way. Kids believe these things. 

Less obvious way is through the stories.

## genesis

there once was innosance then it left. Then there will be moment of redemption. 
    USA: 
    - 1940s things were good. then immigrations came.
    - 1776: Founders got it right. 

    people want to go to the past were things were right.


    Russia
        Ivan llyin: the world is flawed. but russia can restore the innocence. 

    Anti-collonial: 

    Hebrew bible: 
        peple had state. bad People came took the state. Some day they will get the state back. Everything will be fine.


National rebirth: going back to past. 

Very wide spread: Jewish. Greeks. 

Not that this is true. 

story is reflecting something. way of handling the change. 
change is entrance of people in politics. 
not monarchy. not rule by few. Nation means form of polictics, where subjects are people.

 (people against it also say they favor it)

this is new. couple of hundred years old.

way back when people were incharge, now they are going to be again.

what is changing?
    is it capitalsm
    functional state? (taxes, military)

something is changing.  

Modern politics.
- this story(national story) is displacing other story. 
    - divine right. 
    - Inheritance (you are king, because your father was king)
    - 

in our system inheritance is common-sense. (Property is inherited)

Marxism also has this story. 

## How did Ukarineneans think about nation?

19th century: 
    Russian empire
        going to the people (populism), and knowing who they were. 

        in the empire there are people whose folklore, language are different.
